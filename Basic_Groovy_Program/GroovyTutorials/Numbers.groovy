/**
1	xxxValue()
This method takes on the Number as the parameter and returns a primitive type based on the method which is invoked.

2	compareTo()
The compareTo method is to use compare one number against another. This is useful if you want to compare the value of numbers.

3	equals()
The method determines whether the Number object that invokes the method is equal to the object that is passed as argument.

4	valueOf()
The valueOf method returns the relevant Number Object holding the value of the argument passed.

5	toString()
The method is used to get a String object representing the value of the Number Object.

6	parseInt()
This method is used to get the primitive data type of a certain String. parseXxx() is a static method and can have one argument or two.

7	abs()
The method gives the absolute value of the argument. The argument can be int, float, long, double, short, byte.

8	ceil()
The method ceil gives the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to the argument.

9	floor()
The method floor gives the largest integer that is less than or equal to the argument.

10	rint()
The method rint returns the integer that is closest in value to the argument.

11	round()
The method round returns the closest long or int, as given by the methods return type.

12	min()
The method gives the smaller of the two arguments. The argument can be int, float, long, double.

13	max()
The method gives the maximum of the two arguments. The argument can be int, float, long, double.

14	exp()
The method returns the base of the natural logarithms, e, to the power of the argument.

15	log()
The method returns the natural logarithm of the argument.

16	pow()
The method returns the value of the first argument raised to the power of the second argument.

17	sqrt()
The method returns the square root of the argument.

18	sin()
The method returns the sine of the specified double value.

19	cos()
The method returns the cosine of the specified double value.

20	tan()
The method returns the tangent of the specified double value.

21	asin()
The method returns the arcsine of the specified double value.

22	acos()
The method returns the arccosine of the specified double value.

23	atan()
The method returns the arctangent of the specified double value.

24	atan2()
The method Converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinate (r, theta) and returns theta.

25	toDegrees()
The method converts the argument value to degrees.

26	radian()
The method converts the argument value to radians.

27	random()
The method is used to generate a random number between 0.0 and 1.0. The range is: 0.0 =< Math.random < 1.0. Different ranges can be achieved by using arithmetic.
